# an LDAP connection can be used to connect to an LDAP server to blacklist or
# whitelist a set of users according to a submitted query. If not blacklist
# or whitelist is specified, all these settings are ignored. This feature is
# useful if there are some users in active directory that also exist as
# users in Google Apps but are supposed to be excluded from the connector
# service
# ldap.url,user and password are the general login information
# ldap.authMethod is the protocol to be used for communication (default
#     is "DIGEST-MD5", "simple" is unencrypted, others can be used if supported
#     by the ldap server
#     IMPORTANT: To use DIGEST-MD5, the configured windows user account in
#     Active Directory must have enabled "Store password using reversible 
#     encryption" set via Active Directory Users and Computers. 
#     Once this value in enabled the password must be changed in order to store 
#     the password stored in the reversible encryption format.
# ldap.base is the base for the ldap queries
# ldap.whitelist: if this filter is set, only users who match this filter are
#     synced
# ldap.blacklist: if this filter is set, only users who do NOT match this filter
#     are synced
# ldap.blindFaith tells the LDAP connection to accept any https certificate,
#    regardless of whether it can be found in the keystore or not (for LDAPS
#    URLs)
# ldap.domainMap: if set to a non-empty string, this parameter should parse 
#    to a set of rules (expressed as semicolon-separated-list of pairs 
#    googleDomain,exchangeDomain) for domains that should be translated. 
#    For example, with a list
#      foo.com,foo.exchange.com; bar.com,bar.exchange.com
#    a user's exchange email joe@foo.exchange.com would be transformed to
#    joe@foo.com.

# After new users have been imported by the tool, certain adjustments to their
# representation in Exchange need to be made to enable free/busy lookup 
# through the connector. Until this has happened, email can be sent to those
# users, but free/busy lookup will fail. The tool is called on a regular
# basis by this service. These parameters should not need to be changed by
# the system administrator. The values for "timeout" and "frequency" are
# both in seconds. Timeout is the time in seconds that the program will wait
# before killing the external process (in case it hangs). Frequency is the
# time the program will wait after execution to call the tool again.
