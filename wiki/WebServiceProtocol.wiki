= Google Calendar Web Service Protocol =

== Introduction ==

The Google Calendar Connector Web Service relies on a feature in Google Calendar to allow external Free Busy information to be included in the meeting scheduler dialog. This requires a Google Apps domain to have this feature enabled and for the endpoint of the Google Calendar Connector Web Service to be configured. This document describes the protocol used when a request is issued by Google Calendar.

== Details ==

When the Google Calendar client needs free/busy information for a user whose calendar does not reside in Google Calendar, a POST request will be made to the URL configured for the domain.
