=== 2. Before You Install === 

Before you install and configure the Google Calendar Connector Web Service, make sure your Windows environment meets the following prerequisites, and that Google Calendar and Exchange are prepared for sharing data.

=== 2.1 Prerequisites ===
  
* Google Apps Premier Edition domain


To support the Web Service, your Windows environment must meet these prerequisites:
 * Microsoft Windows Server 2003
 * Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0
 * Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 SP2
 * ASP.NET 2.

=== 2.2 Google Calendar Account Setup ===

To prepare Google Calendar for sharing free/busy data, you must perform these tasks:


  * Specify the Google Calendar Connector Web Service URL.
 As part of your pre-installation planning, determine where to install and run the Web Service in IIS. You must provide the web service URL to the Google Enterprise Support Organization (ESO). ESO will ensure your Google Apps domain is configured for the Google Calendar Connector interoperability and that the URL is properly entered in your domain settings on the Google Calendar server.  It is important to understand the implications of using a private or publicly accessible Web Service URL.  Using a publicly accessible URL would potentially allow other domains to perform free/busy lookups against your users.  For this reason, providing a private URL which is only accessible to users of your domain may be preferred.


 * Create dedicated Google Apps service account and perform an initial login.

 The user name and password are required when you populate the GoogleApps.AdminUser.Login and Password parameters in the configuration process. NOTE: Before this account can be used with the connector you must login to Google Apps account and accept the standard terms of service agreement for the user account.
