LIBRARIES USED BY THE PROGRAM
=============================

Download the following libraries and add their jar files here:

- Google Collections (from http://code.google.com/p/google-collections/)
- GData Java Client (from http://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/)
- Anything GData absolutely depends on (nothing at the time of this writing)

If the latest version comes in an archive (zip-file), just take all the jar files the archive contains and put them here.
