Libaries supporting ANT tasks
=============================
Download the latest version of jsmooth from http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net and place the following items in this folder:

- jsmoothgen-ant.jar (a custom ant task to create windows executables)
- skeletons (a folder from the same jsmooth archive)

Both the jar file and the skeletons-folder are part of one single download from the web page.

WARNING:
THIS IS AN OPTIONAL STEP IN THE BUILD PROCESS AND ONLY REQUIRED IF YOU NEED WINDOWS EXECUTABLES. IT IS INCLUDED FOR
CONVENIENCE ONLY. EVERYTHING IN THE BUILD SCRIPT EXCEPT THE TASKS "jsmoothgen", "exe " AND "dist" WILL WORK JUST AS
WELL. COMMENT OUT THOSE THREE TASKS IF YOU DO NOT INTEND TO USE THEM.

IF YOU DECIDE TO USE JSMOOTH, PLEASE CHECK THE LICENSE AGREEMENT AT http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/license.php .
