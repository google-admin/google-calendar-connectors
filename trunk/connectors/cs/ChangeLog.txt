v0.31 [21-Dec-2007]
------------------
* NEW FEATURE: Support domain mapping between the Google Apps domain and the
  local domain - e.g. example.org <-> example.corp.domain implies that
  WebService queries for user@example.org will actually lookup 
  user@example.corp.domain.
* NEW FEATURE: Improved the Diagnostics page so it makes it easier to diagnose
  problems and tell when something is not working. Remove the Google Calendar
  user lookup diagnostic which required the Provisioning API enabled on the 
  domain.
* NEW FEATURE: New support for Appointment fetching using a single request.
* NEW FEATURE: New support for Date Constrained Free Busy Lookup (optional).
* BUG FIX: Schedule+ Free Busy writer now uses the GCalQuery Admin account

  the same.

  computed

v0.30 [13-Dec-2007]
------------------
* BUG FIX: Support authentication with Exchange clusters. WebDAV requests
  that are redirected to another server were failing with authentication
  failures. Redirection is now handled manually to allow reauthentcation
  and the domains permitted to redirect can be controlled by an app setting.
* Integrated with latest version of GData API

v0.28 [4-Dec-2007]
------------------
* BUG FIX: Added configuration option to disable HTTP
  KeepAlives.  This may solve situations where "The underlying connection
  was closed" error occur during synchronization.  This option can be set 
  in the config file as:
  <add key="SyncService.EnableKeepAlive" value="true"/>

* NEW FEATURE: The LDAP debug statement recorded in the log
  now includes Active Directory "distinguishedName" and "objectclass"
  properties for each user.


v0.27 [30-Nov-2007]
-------------------
* BUG FIX: [From Barnaby] LDAP queries were previously limited to returning
  a maximum of 1,000 users.  This limit has been removed.

  
v0.26 [2-Nov-2007]
------------------
* BUG FIX: Exchange user calendar URLs are now constucted using the Exchange
  user's Primary SMTP address (as opposed to the mailnickname).  The Primary
  SMTP address is found by querying Active Directory for the user's 
  ProxyAddresses attributes, enumerating the results, and choosing the entry
  that begins with "SMTP:" (this is case sensitive).

  
v0.25 [24-Oct-2007]
-------------------
* NEW FEATURE: Diagnostics web page now has a "Write Free Busy message" test
  that will write a message directly to the SchedulePlus Free Busy folder.
  Note that this requires the AdminGroup and and TemplateUserName config keys
  to be set.


v0.24 [22-Oct-2007]
-------------------
* NEW FEATURE: All LDAP attributes we're using are now logged as we read them
  from the LDAP resultset.  This turned out to be less information (weight-
  wise) than I was anticipating, so I put it in the regular debug logs.

* NEW FEATURE: Diagnostics web page now has a "Query Active Directory" test 
  where you can input an LDAP query and see what GCalExchange returns.  This 
  follows the same code path as the AD query that is used in the sync process.

* BUG FIX: Fixed an issue when querying f/b in Exchange for a user w/ an empty 
  f/b message.  If the message was completely empty, we were throwing an error.
